# Liver_physics_model_based_on_Deep_Learning_and_SOFA

This is a code repository for training deep learning neural networks using the SOFA environment. The repository is divided into three parts:
1. SOFA environment model with appropriate material properties, -
2. Python code for generating data (batches) based on SOFA stimulation node displacement
3. A neural network design for learning strain prediction
