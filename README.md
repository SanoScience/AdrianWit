# SOFA_physics_model_based_on_Deep_Learning

This is a code repository for training deep learning neural networks using the SOFA environment. The repository is divided into 3 parts:
- SOFA environment model with appropriate material properties, -
- Python code for generating data (batches) based on SOFA stimulation node displacement
- A neural network design for learning strain prediction
