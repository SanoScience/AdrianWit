# Liver physics model based on Deep Learning and SOFA

This is a code repository for deep learning neural networks physics training using the SOFA environment. Deep Learning is performed on the liver model as a example. The repository is divided into four parts:
1. SOFA environment liver model definition with appropriate material properties,
2. Python code for generating data (batches) based on SOFA simulation node displacement,
3. A neural network design for learning strain prediction,
4. Visualization of model strain driven by NN.
