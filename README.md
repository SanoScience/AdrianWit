# Liver_physics_model_based_on_Deep_Learning_and_SOFA

This is a code repository for training deep learning neural networks using the SOFA environment. The repository is divided into four parts:
1. SOFA environment model with appropriate material properties,
2. Python code for generating data (batches) based on SOFA stimulation node displacement,
3. A neural network design for learning strain prediction.
4. Visualization of model strain driven by NN
